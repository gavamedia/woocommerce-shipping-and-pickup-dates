== Description ==
A WooCommerce Extension that adds shipping or pickup dates to your WooCommerce checkout.

Create your own custom delivery or pickup dates. These dates can even start far into the future, which is important for seasonal businesses or pre-orders.

Let your customers choose their preferred pickup or shipping date during checkout.

You also have flexible date options. You can even choose shipping or pickup dates that start well into the future, instead of starting from today.

Your customers can order today, and choose pickup or delivery dates far into the future, when your products are available.

Seasonal businesses can also benefit by setting custom pickup or shipping dates. Let customers order now, and make the delivery or pickup date options work around your growing season.
