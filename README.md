# WooCommerce Shipping and Pickup Dates for WordPress

A WooCommerce Extension that adds shipping or pickup dates to your WooCommerce checkout.

Create your own custom delivery or pickup dates. These dates can even start far into the future, which is important for seasonal businesses or pre-orders.

## What it does

This lets your customers choose their preferred pickup or shipping date during checkout.

## Dates far into the future

You have flexible date options. You can even choose shipping or pickup dates that start well into the future, instead of starting from today.

### Pre-orders

Let your customers order today, and choose pickup or delivery dates far into the future, when your product is available.

#### Deliver/shipping dates for seasonal businesses

Seasonal businesses can benefit by setting custom pickup or shipping dates. Let customers order now, and make the delivery or pickup date options work around your growing season.
